# Todo List Application

A simple console-based Todo List application where you can add, delete, complete tasks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Python 3.0
- datetime library for Python

### Installing

A step-by-step guide to getting a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emkbt/DT--Kilbertus--5--ToDoList--

2. Navigate to the project directory.

   ```bash
   cd DT--Kilbertus--5--ToDoList--

3. Run the project.

   ```bash
   python todo_app.py

## Running the tests

Currently, this project does not have automated tests. However, you can manually test the functionality by running the application and checking if the basic operations (adding, deleting, completing tasks) work as expected.

### Break down into end to end tests

The manual tests cover the following scenarios:

- **Adding a Task:**
  - Enter a task, and verify that it is added to the list.

- **Deleting a Task:**
  - Enter an existing task, and verify that it is removed from the list.

- **Completing a Task:**
  - Enter an existing task, and verify that it is marked as complete.

### Coding style tests

Since this is a simple console application, formal coding style tests may not be necessary. However, it's a good practice to follow PEP 8 or other relevant style guides.
